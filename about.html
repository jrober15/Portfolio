    <h2>About Me (and my art!)</h2>
    <p>Hello! Thanks for checking out my art. My name is Jayna -- I'm a 20-year-old traditional and digital artist based in Eugene, Oregon. I'm also a third-year student at the University of Oregon where I'm studying Art and Technology! 
      I've been experimenting with different styles and mediums since I was very young, but the majority of my body of work consists of illustration and animation.
      This website contains a few samples of my artwork from recent years.
